Controls Windows Media Player using messages it receives over a TCP connection


This simple little python script listens for a TCP connection and runs system
commands based on what it receives. I wrote it for the purpose of controlling 
Windows Media Player. I used WMP instead of VLC out of laziness - it was easier.
